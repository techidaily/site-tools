### A Word from Our Customers

**Listen to your audiobooks on the player of your choice! Epubor Audible Converter is great.**  
We really need a method of listening to our own audiobooks in the format that is easiest. The audible app is ok but not the best to use. I prefer to us my own audiobook player and this software offers the option to do this!
