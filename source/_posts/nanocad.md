nanoCAD is a modern computer-aided design (CAD) platform that provides designers with powerful capabilities in 2D drafting and 3D modeling.

nanoCAD can be used on its own as a cost-effective DWG-editor, or customized with essential modules: Construction, Mechanica, Raster, Topoplan and 3D Solid Modeling.

## 5. nanoCAD is the right choice for you

### 5.1. It is an All-inclusive CAD Platform

![cad](/images/apps/nanocad/pages/CAD.svg)

nanoCAD is designed to get your work done no matter which industry you’re in. With it, you can create drawings from simple to complex, supported by international standards. The program has been successfully deployed across various disciplines such as mechanical engineering, building design, architecture, site design and landscaping. It combines a familiar interface with a powerful set of tools, native DWG files and responsive technical support to make it simply the best choice.

### 5.2. It is a Native DWG Editor

![dwg](/images/apps/nanocad/pages/DWG.svg)

nanoCAD runs in the industry’s standard DWG format. It’s the same one other CAD systems are based on, such as AutoCAD. nanoCAD was in fact designed from the very beginning to use DWG natively - no translation or conversion needed. Nanosoft is an Open Design Alliance Member. nanoCAD even supports complex DWG objects, like 3D point clouds and IFC models.

### 5.3. It has an Open API for Developers

![api](/images/apps/nanocad/pages/API.svg)

nanoCAD offers an AutoCAD-compatible programming platform at no cost. Thus gives the possibility to accustom and develop CAD applications according to one's needs. Feel free to integrate calculations, automate design activities and link drawings with external databases. Run already created add-ins from other members of our developers’ club. nanoCAD’s API interface supports the following programming languages and technologies: C, C++, C#, COM, .NET, LISP, VBscript, JavaScript, and command scripting..

### 5.4. It has a Familiar user Interface

![interface](/images/apps/nanocad/pages/Interface.svg)

If you are grounded in other DWG CAD then consider yourself at home with nanoCAD. The screen layout and its command structure are highly distinguishable and user-friendly. Even if it’s been a while since you’ve worked in CAD, you’ll get up to the speed and productivity in no time - quick and easy. Especially useful for mechanical engineering, building design, architecture, site design and landscaping.

### 5.5. It has Annual Updates

![update](/images/apps/nanocad/pages/update.svg)

Every year a new version is coming. The new nanoCAD 23 release is full of new ways to create, compare and communicate. Five optional modules 3D Solid Modeling, Construction, Mechanica, Raster, Topoplan expands nanoCAD 23 functionality. Create with 3D Solid Modeling module using 2D and 3D parametric constraints to turn parts into assemblies. Edit scanned drawings and convert them to CAD with Raster module. Planning earthworks is easy with Topoplan module.

### 5.6. It has Great technical Support

![support](/images/apps/nanocad/pages/support.svg)

nanoCAD users with valid subscriptions are entitled to technical support during the use of the software, provided via email and help-desk. Free support is provided by nanoCAD's community through the Nanosoft forum. Nanosoft professionals and partners are also part of the community.

### 5.7. Licensing
