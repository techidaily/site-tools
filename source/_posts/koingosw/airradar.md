WiFi On Demand
Finding a free WiFi network while on vacation can be a nightmare. Using advanced GPS technology, AirRadar scans and places all networks on a map. While walking or driving, AirRadar automatically updates the location of networks when it finds a better signal elsewhere.

Open networks are clearly marked with a green dot, and closed networks with a red dot. Simply throw the laptop on the passenger seat before leaving the house for the day, and after a day of driving, have a comprehensive map of open networks!
