Set up your complete development environment using the Advanced Installer extension for Visual Studio. This feature is available in all editions, including Freeware, and our support starts with Visual Studio 2010 up to the latest version.

Starting with version 13.4 of Advanced Installer, the Visual Studio extension can be installed independently from the Advanced Installer setup package. You can download the extension from the Visual Studio Marketplace or our website.

The extension allows you to build your Advanced Installer projects at the same time with your Visual Studio solutions and seamlessly integrate with MSBuild. You can also create a new Advanced Installer project from the Visual Studio New Project dialog.

### MSIX Packaging and Debugging

From a single project, you can build both MSI and MSIX packages.

The Advanced Installer extension for Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2022 provides unique support for debugging your desktop application inside a MSIX app container.
