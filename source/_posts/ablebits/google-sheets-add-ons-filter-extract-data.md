**Filter and Extract Data for Google Sheets**
Easy way to filter multiple columns by multiple conditions

Filter and Extract Data scans your entire table and fetches those records that match the conditions you set. Unlike the regular filter, the tool lets you filter multiple columns by multiple conditions at once. All you need to do is select the range and tweak the conditions. The tool will build a QUERY formula for you bringing back every matching record into the desired place.
