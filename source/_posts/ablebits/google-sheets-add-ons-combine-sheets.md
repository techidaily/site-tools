**Combine sheets in Google Sheets**
Combine data from multiple sheets into one sheet

This add-on pulls data from multiple Google spreadsheets into one without copy-pasting. Even if your tables differ in formatting, column order or contents, Combine Sheets will join your sheets to one table using column headers. You tell the tool what sheets to merge, what to do with formatting & where to put the results in just 2 steps. And it's up to you to have the outcome as a formula so it updates in sync with the source sheets.
