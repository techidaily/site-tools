**Split Sheet for Google Sheets**
Split one table into multiple sheets by columns or rows

With this add-on, you are just 3 steps away from splitting your Google sheet into several different tables. The tool groups all data by common records in one or more selected columns or by the number of rows you specify, and puts each group on an individual sheet. It's up to you whether to place all resulting sheets next to the source tab, to a brand new spreadsheet, or to multiple separate files.
