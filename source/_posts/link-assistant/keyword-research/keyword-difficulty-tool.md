## What is Keyword Difficulty?

Keyword Difficulty is an SEO metric showing **how hard it would be to rank in the top 10 results** for any given keyword in Google or any other target search engine of your choice.

The algorithm behind the Keyword Difficulty score is dead simple. Our tool compares top-ranking pages for the main ranking signals, such as domain authority, the number of backlinks and their quality, and estimates the score based on how strong your page is against all other competing pages.

Not sure how it works? Give it a try with the Keyword Difficulty checker in Rank Tracker – one of the best **SEO tools for estimating your traffic potential**. See it yourself – download the software and do keyword research absolutely free of charge.

## How our Keyword Difficulty tool works

To assess the Keyword Difficulty score, the checker analyzes the top 10 ranking pages for a certain keyword according to a wealth of important metrics like:

InLink Rank (close to PageRank)

Sites referring to a page

Sites referring to a domain

After analyzing all the factors, the tool checks the page strength against the top 10 competing websites and comes up with the total value for the keyword. It forecasts how hard it will be for the page to outrank each individual competitor in the top 10 on the SERP for this query.

## How exactly the Keyword Difficulty metric can help you

**Prioritize the right keywords**, separately or in bulk, based on how much effort it will take for your pages to rank

**Match Keyword Difficulty score, search volume** and **organic search competition** to see the best keyword opportunities

**Explore the local search competition** with your custom settings for any search engine and geolocation

**Save time, money, and effort** by picking the keywords able to bring more earnings for your site at a lower cost

**Do bulk keyword research** in a matter of minutes with the most extensive keyword database

Embed the Keyword Difficulty metric into **your long-term SEO strategy**

## Prioritize the right keywords

Optimizing a website, the last thing you probably want is to drown under a huge amount of rubbishy data. Don't waste your efforts on keywords that will hardly bring you any traffic to the site. Prioritize keywords that have the potential to maximize your SEO results.

Check Keyword Difficulty to spot the most effective queries

Spot keywords that have the highest chances of bringing tons of organic traffic and don't require much optimization work. The checker determines keyword difficulty as Low, Medium, and High. Examine the phrases colored with a green marker – these are your best optimization opportunities.

Combine the Keyword Difficulty metric with other factors

Take a look at the Keyword Difficulty metric in combination with Search Volume and Competition. To choose the right keywords quicker, consult the Keyword Effectiveness Index (KEI) which is based on all the three metrics above.

## Find the right balance between Keyword Difficulty and search volume

Low-competition keywords with low search volume

Usually, these are **long-tail keywords that enjoy a higher click-through rate** from organic search. They are easier to rank for because pretty often they have low competition (which is not a strict rule, though).

Less competitive keywords with higher search volumes

Rare but lucky finds especially helpful for niche topics. If you find **low competition keywords** with **considerable search volume**, organic traffic won’t keep you waiting. These are the perfect keywords for new websites and the easiest to rank for.

High-competition keywords with high search volumes

These are for a long-term SEO game. With time, you will find your site competing for **high-search volume keywords** as well. To catch up with the competition level, you will need to create great content and get yourself high-quality backlinks.
