Explore keyword ideas with YouTube autocomplete suggestions

YouTube autocomplete works just like Google autocomplete. When you type a target keyword into the YouTube search bar, you see about a dozen autocomplete suggestions. But why not find long tail keywords more effectively?

For that, you can use a free keyword suggestion tool in Rank Tracker. By harnessing the potential of the YouTube autocomplete feature, the tool generates keyword suggestions based on popular queries on a larger scale. Just enter several seed keywords and get a YouTube keyword list of the most popular queries.

Filter high-potential video keywords

YouTube doesn't spill the beans on its keyword stats, making it challenging to gauge the effectiveness of a keyword. But fear not as the Rank Tracker keyword tool gathers statistics from various search engines to estimate performance metrics on YouTube.

And the best part? You can use customizable filters to get rid of queries with low search volumes and high competition, leaving profitable YouTube keyword ideas only.

The keyword tool will compile a list of keyword suggestions proven effective for your competitors.

Optimize YouTube videos for traffic growth

Producing a good video takes time and effort. That's why YouTube SEO is absolutely necessary to maximize the visibility of your videos. Once you complete the thorough YouTube keyword research, you will have dozens of profitable long tail keywords for video optimization.
