## Why go after long-tail keywords?

While long-tail keywords have lower search volumes, they target visitors with a much stronger purchase intent — long-tail keywords have three times the conversion rate of short-tail keywords. Problem is, there are dozens of long-tail keywords per each short-tail one, so it's a real challenge to find all of them and to identify the ones that will actually bring you traffic — an impossible task without a reliable keyword research software.

**Choose a keyword research tool**  
out of over twenty options

Rank Tracker SEO software comes with 24 keyword research tools. You can discover the keywords that you already rank for, find those keywords that your competitors rank for, and use a number of semantic keyword research methods to find related questions, related searches, and autocomplete suggestions. Some of those are general-purpose SEO tools and will deliver a mix of both long-tail and short-tail keywords, while others are designed specifically for finding long-tail keywords. Rank Tracker also comes with filters that will help you isolate long-tail keywords from the lists that contain both long and short keywords.

**Discover keywords that rank**  
for you and your competitors

Enter any website or page, be it yours or your competitors', and discover top-performing keywords in any of the most popular search engines. This will give you an understanding of which keywords work well and provide you with a direction for future keyword research and search engine optimization. Furthermore, you can enter up to five competitor websites and discover those keywords that they rank for and you don't. It might be a good idea to borrow those keyword ideas right away — they've been battle-tested by your competitors and proved useful, so there is no reason you shouldn't be using them in your SEO effort.

**Generate new keyword ideas**  
using semantic research methods

Put together a few of your most important seed keywords and enter them into one of our long-tail keyword finders. Use autocomplete tools to discover best long-tail keyword suggestions from some of the most popular search engines, including Google, Yahoo, Yandex, and Bing. Use related searches to find long-tail keywords around a certain topic. Use related questions to see what interests people about a certain topic — keywords discovered this way are full of ideas for Q&A sections and how-to guides. Rank Tracker is also equipped with word mixers and combinators, but those are more of a wild-card type of keyword generators — producing a mix of random keyword suggestions.

**Isolate long-tail keywords**  
by applying custom filters

Depending on the keyword generators you choose, there will be varying shares of short-tail keywords mixed in with the long-tail ones. Luckily, each keyword finder is equipped with customizable filters and one of those filters allows you to define the number of words you want in your keywords. Now, long-tail keywords are not always long in terms of the number of words, but, as a rule of thumb, they do tend to be three words or longer. Additionally, the results of all of your keyword searches are added to the keyword sandbox, which means you don't have to filter each of your lists individually — you can do all of them once they are pulled together.

**Find high potential keywords**  
by analyzing keyword statistics

Once you've merged your keyword lists and got rid of short-tail keywords, it's time to figure out which of the remaining keywords are the best fit for your search engine optimization strategy. To assist you in this quest, Rank Tracker supplies each keyword with essential statistics, such as search volume, competition, keyword difficulty, expected visits, and even pay-per-click costs. The usual strategy would be to filter out the low volume and high competition keywords, exclude negative words, and set a range for PPC costs. Keywords may also be grouped by topic, which might be of help when deciding on the types of pages to create.
