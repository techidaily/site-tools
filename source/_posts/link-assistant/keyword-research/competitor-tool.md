**Competitive keyword analysis** is absolutely vital for any website. When you start a fresh campaign or validate your on going SEO strategies, you do SEO competitor research. And it can't be successful without **competitor analysis tools**. In SEO PowerSuite, there's a host of free SEO tools baked-in to help you research competitors' keywords.

For a start, it will be useful to **get a list of your keyword competitors**. Of course, you can do the entire thing by hand, but checking Google results manually is incredibly time-consuming. Alternatively, you can find your SERP competitors with Rank Tracker.

**Domain Competitors**

Find **competitors ranking for the same keywords** as you do in organic results. You'll see exactly what domains that come up the most frequently and seem to be your biggest rivals.

The dashboard shows how proximate the competitors are one to another in terms of **organic traffic** and **keywords**. Sort the competitors by Intersection to find those with whom you overlap the most.

See the competitive analysis metrics:

- Competitor's organic traffic
- Competitors' unique keywords
- Competitor's total number of keywords

## Find competitors' keywords

Once you have the list of domains, it's time to find the keywords your competitors are targeting in your niche, which will then guide your content creation. After some keyword analysis, you will know exactly which terms, and therefore, which topics you might still need to cover.

**Competitors' ranking keywords**

One of the most effective keyword research strategies is to look at how your SEO competitors rank in search results. Find keywords of competitors you aren't targeting yet and think how to embed them into your own content.

[Rank Tracker keyword research tool](https://www.link-assistant.com/seo-workflow/keyword-research.html) has the perfect module for this called Ranking Keywords. It helps you quickly see all the ranking keywords of any website. Besides, you will be able to check competitor keyword stats, which makes the tool indispensable for competitive keyword research.

![Keyword gap tool](https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/images/common-theme/landings/keyword-research/competitor-tool/keyword-gap@2x.webp)

**Keyword gap**

Keyword gap is a brilliant tactic helping to generate keyword suggestions and discover opportunities for content creation. The bad news: you can't effectively do all keyword gap research by hand. The good news: this is exactly why our Keyword gap tool was created.

In the Keyword _Research > Keyword Gap_, you can compare your domain with up to 5 of your competitors. Check common keywords for your website and any/all of your competitors. Alternatively, see the keywords that all competitors target, but you don't.

**Google Ads Keyword Tool**

For a long time, Google Ads Keyword Planner has been one of the most helpful tools to assess Google keywords. If you are looking for a way to simplify your SEO vs PPC estimates, Rank Tracker offers an in-built Keyword Planner.

All you need to do is go to _Keyword Research > Keyword Planner_ and enter your keywords. Here, besides the basic SEO metrics, you will get the number of expected ads clicks, cost-per-click metric, and estimated PPC costs per month.

![TF-IDF keyword research to analyze how competitors use your keywords in their content](https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/images/common-theme/landings/keyword-research/competitor-tool/TF-IDF-tool@2x.webp)

**TF-IDF tool**

The SEO tool is in fact a statistical method that will give you a clue how relevant keywords might be to a certain topic. Try the _TF-IDF Explorer_ in the _Keyword Research_ module to find out a keyword usage specific. The explorer will comb through all of the pages ranking for your target keyword.

The tool will show the number (percentage) of competitors using your keyword of interest, and calculate the maximum, the minimum, and the average TF-IDF scores. Simply put, it checks how important the keyword is based on its requency on the competing pages.

## Choose relevant keywords

to improve your content

For the competitor keyword research to be really effective, there is a whale of keyword analysis to do before starting to optimize your landing pages. Is it possible to rank for a competitor's keyword quickly? What website traffic can these keywords potentially bring? Should I do search optimization or paid ads for certain keywords? How much would it cost to run a PPC campaign?

In Rank Tracker's analysis tools, all these questions can be answered with the help of SEO metrics, such as:

Keyword Efficiency Index (KEI)

## Handle hundreds of keywords

in a couple of clicks

**Apply quick filters to sort competitors' keywords**

Out of thousands of keyword phrases, you will need to find the happy medium. The most effective keyword is Low in Competition but high in search volume.

Another lifehack is to find **long-tail keywords** and use them first. Unlike short-tail keywords, long-tails are extremely specific and usually correlate with the phrase length. Long-tail keywords drive less traffic, but they are easier to rank for and convert better. So, apply the respective filter to spot the most profitable keywords.
