- Can my iPhone use a fake GPS?

    Yes. There are no so-called fake GPS location settings in your iOS system. What's worse, Apple does not tolerate any GPS spoofer apps on its App Store. Those you find in the App Store are not the real stuff, not trustworthy. There are two reliable methods to fake GPS on iPhone in the market: 1) to use a computer program, 2) to use a VPN.  
    A computer program focuses more on GPS and can teleport your location to any desired place on the globe and simulate the movement along a specified route. A VPN is more IP address-focused. That is to say, it changes your location by using a different IP address.
