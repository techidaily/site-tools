## Back Up & Restore iOS Data Turns Flexible

- Back up iPhone/iPad/iPod touch automatically and wirelessly.
- Each backup is an increment for a previous backup to save space.
- Preview and restore any item from the backup to iOS/Android devices.
- Restore iCloud/iTunes backups to any device selectively.
- No data loss during transfer, backup, and restore.

## Back Up & Restore Made More Intuitive and Easier

Compared to backing up iPhones with iTunes or iCloud, Dr.Fone can help back up 24 data types, such as photos, videos, music, podcast, books, contacts, blacklist, safari data, reminders, notes, app data, etc., and restore data more flexibly and selectively without overwriting existing data.

### Selective

Restore data selectively according to your needs.

## Back Up Files Wirelessly and Automatically

The automatic, always-on Dr.Fone backup saves you from accidental deletion and dramatically eases the backup task. Once you connect your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch and computer via a lightning cable or the same Wi-Fi, the program will automatically back up data on your iOS device to keep it safe. The new backup file won't overwrite the old one. You can do a backup whenever you want.

## Restore Backups to Any Device Selectively

Just as you'd expect from Dr.Fone, you can easily access your backed-up files anytime from your computer. iTunes and iCloud are the official way to back up iOS devices. But with these methods, you can only restore the entire backup to your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. Now, you can use Dr.Fone to preview the complete iTunes/iCloud/Dr.Fone backup and restore only the files you need to your device.
