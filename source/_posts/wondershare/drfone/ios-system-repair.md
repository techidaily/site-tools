![standard mode without data loss](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/product-2021/system-repair/standard-mode.png)

### 5.1. Standard Mode

Retain User's Data: With this Standard Mode, we can quickly fix almost all system issues without data loss, including crashes, black screens, and getting stuck on the Apple logo or in the Recovery Mode.

![advanced mode with data loss](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/product-2021/system-repair/advanced-mode.png)

### 5.2. Advanced Mode

This mode helps when Standard Repair fails. It supports deep scan to repair in relatively complex scenarios and resets your iDevice to factory settings. Please note that it will erase all your data after recovery.

### 5.3. Anti - Recovery Mode

We recommend this mode if you want to sell your iDevice or want to destroy the data inside the iDevice. It can fix complex iOS system issues and perform deep data erasure on your iDevice, including formatting hard drive chips.

## 8. FAQs - You May Still Be Wondering

- What is Recovery Mode and DFU Mode on iPhone?

    iOS users may often hear about Recovery Mode and DFU Mode. But probably most users don't know what exactly is Recovery Mode and DFU Mode. Now, let me introduce what they are and their differences.

    Recovery Mode is a failsafe in iBoot that is used to revive your iPhone with a new version of iOS. It uses iBoot to restore or upgrade your iPhone.

    DFU Mode, which is known as Device Firmware Update, allows iOS devices to be restored from any state. It is a port of the SecureROM which is built into the hardware. So it can restore the device more thoroughly than the Recovery Mode.
