## 8. FAQs - You May Still Be Wondering 

### 8.1. When do I need to unlock android phone without a password? 

There are various scenarios when people can't successfully enter the Android system. For example, they might just forget the pattern lock or the lock screen password after leaving the phone alone for long. Chances may be that they got a second-hand phone with a lock screen, the lock screen passcode has been set by a naughty kid, or even worse, the screen is locked due to entering the wrong password many times. In all these scenarios, you need an Android lock screen removal tool to bypass the Android lock screen quickly. 

### 8.2. How to disable the lock screen in Android? 

Having a lock screen on your Android can surely protect your privacy well, but it brings some conveniences indeed. With a lock screen, your access to incoming messages or apps is delayed, and it's also a nightmare when the lock screen password or pattern is totally forgotten. So, some people would like to disable the lock screen in Android to make life easy. Here are the simple steps to follow along:

1. Tap the Settings app or the cog icon in the notification shade.
2. Navigate to the Security item.
3. Choose Screen Lock and select None or Swipe (If you already have a lock screen, you need to enter the required password, pattern, or confirm your fingerprint).

### 8.3. How do I lock my Android screen? 

If your Android system has no lock screen, you may consider adding one as this way you can protect your privacy and prevent your data from being peered by unwanted eyes. Just go to Settings > Security > Screen Lock to add a wanted Android screen lock. Here are the most used Android screen locks:

- **Pattern**: You need to draw a pattern before entering the Android system.
- **Password**: You need to enter at least 6 digits to access your Android system. This may be less convenient than a pattern lock screen.
- **PIN**: A PIN Android lock usually has only 4 digits and some people like to use it as a simpler alternative to password screen lock.
